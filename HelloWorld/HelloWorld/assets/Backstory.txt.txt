The world was left in a post technological state after eons of civil war and a lust for power caused the greatest of tragedies. 
The lands lay barren and resources scarce.
The planet has become a desolate star. After some time some civilizations have regressed, eroded by time to a point similar to the late 1800s. 
The-America, in a desperate attempt to regain the empire’s former glory, set their sights on conquest and have spread its influence across the world.
Many knew to be weary from past mistakes, yet had no choice but to agree. The-American forces have landed in Japan and, with no other choice, were allowed them in. 
The government has said it’s time to westernize and align their civilization with The-America. But a few have decided that they would rather die than be complacent. 
A rebellion formed and tried to fight back. Taking up their swords and raising their flags. But try as they may, it was not a winning fight. 
he previously war hungry nation of The-America had weapons and resources far beyond what one rebellion could face.
Samurai were cut down one by one yet there stood a single warrior atop the mountains of corpses.
He knew his time was coming, he had to make his life count. He would not allow this nation to become a relict of the past.
